        <h2>Pyre</h2>
        <p>Supergiants third game. With two highly rated games under their belt, the team felt it was time to experiment. Pyre came out to some criticue and lowest sales to date, most blaming the style of gameplay being boring and shallow. that didnt stop if from having a banger soundtrack though.</p>

        <h2>Hades</h2>
        <p>Supergiants fourth game. After many years of development, Hades finally releases to great critical sucsess, with many posetive reviws. Even though it won best action game at "the game awards", i think it has one of the weakest OSTs.</p>
